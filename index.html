<p><h3>The <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr></h3><br>
the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> is designed to protect personal data stored on computers or in an organised paper filing system. It covers the protection of personal data like bank details, names and adresses and its safety when it is being colected and stored. The act also gives people rights to protect themselves against any misuse of data held about them.</p>
<p><h3>The <abbr title="Computer  Misuse Act">CMA</abbr></h3><br>
the <abbr title="Computer Misuse Act">CMA</abbr> is designed to protect computer users against wilful attacks and theft of information. Offences under the act include hacking, unauthorised access to computer systems and purposefully spreading malicious and damaging software  </p>
<p><h3>The <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patent Act">CDPA</abbr></h3><br>
  the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patent Act">CDPA</abbr> was designed to protect the copyright of individuals and groups. The act protects the ownership of computer software in a similar way that copyright works with printed material. This act protects the software developer's rights and lasts for fifty years after the writer's death. most copywrightec materials have a &copy symbol on them and most patented things say that they are patented.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In 2018 most of the above laws will become more strict. The new law wil be called <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
